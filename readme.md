### Note Enojes

Note Enojes is a library to convert eno lang locale files to ListResourceBundle java classes ready for use with java MessageFormatter. Uses Java v8 syntax, includes a Java v9 module descriptor. (Incomplete)

Eno is a document / data structure specification. Its authors provide gettext compatible files through the [eno-locales](https://github.com/eno-lang/eno-locales) repository.

"Note Enojes" is a misspellt spanish phrase telling (informal)you not to get angry. I chose it partly as reference to the Enohar library, and because note is some text in english, which is relevant for translating text.
